# Where should I move to in California?

## Introduction

A friend of mine currently residing in Florida wants to relocate to California to have a better life but is confused which city to choose. He would like to stay in a place where there is great weather, fantastic food, top notch education, plenty of adventures and a thrilling night life. He has shortlisted a couple of cities and would like to select one of them. The shortlisted cities are San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose and San Diego. Our goal is to explore these cities and recommend the best one.

## Data 

To solve the above problem, we are going to use the Foursquare location data. We are going to explore venues in each of the 4 cities and see what each city has to offer and whatâ€™s unique about it. We can analyse the top venues in each city, ratings given by users to different venues as well as different venue categories.
